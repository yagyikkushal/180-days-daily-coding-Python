# Given an array of numbers representing a branch on a binary tree, write a Python program to find the minimum even value and its index. In the case of a tie, return the smallest index. If there are no even numbers, the answer is [].

templist = []

for _ in mylist:
    if _%2 == 0:
        templist.append(_)
        
templist = sorted(templist)

if not templist:
    print(templist)
else:
    reslist = [templist[0],mylist.index(templist[0])]
    print(reslist)
